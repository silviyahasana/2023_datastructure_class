## 2023 Data Structure Class

- Original hands-on coding are written in C++ following the 2023 syllabus, however Python version has been added as well.
- This repo serves as an archive. Feel free to use it to brush up on your Data Structure skills. 
- You'd see me use vim throughout the course, but it is not mandatory ! We don't gatekeep in this class, use whatever code editor you're comfortable with - Visual Studio Code, Sublime, or Atom are all good choices.
- Discussions are encouraged, however write your own homework for submission. Copying and pasting will result in a failing grade (E).
- To keep things organized and avoid repeating questions, please post your questions in our class group chat.

Best of luck !
